Royal Nitro Gen
Welcome to the official Royal Nitro Gen directory in executable version! This program, designed to make generating Nitro Discord links as simple as possible, is perfect for users who want to experiment or learn more about the generation process in a fun and safe way.

Important: This project is made for educational and demonstration purposes only. It generates Nitro links in valid but fictitious format, which cannot be used to activate Nitro services on Discord. The use of this program must remain within the framework of learning and demonstration.

Main Features
Customizing the Number of Links: Choose exactly how many Nitro links you want to generate at once.
Simplified Use: Thanks to its executable version, no installation of third-party software (such as Python) is required.
Intuitive User Interface: Enjoy a simple and clear interface, making the program accessible even for less experienced users.
How to use
Download the Nitro generator .exe file from the project releases.
Run the downloaded file. Depending on your operating system, you might receive a security warning because the executable file came from an external source. If you trust the source, allow the program to run.
Once the program launches, follow the on-screen instructions to enter the number of Nitro links you want to generate.
After entering the desired number and confirming, the generated links will be displayed on the screen. You can copy them or simply view them.
Safety and Warnings
The executable file was created for educational purposes only. Make sure to download the program from a trusted source to avoid any malware risks.
Again, the generated links are fictitious and should not be used with the intention of obtaining Discord Nitro services illegitimately.
